# GazeList

GazeList is a to-do app aiming to simplify management of tasks while preserving advanced functionality. Everything from location-based reminders, voice memos and sharing with other users is made easy by GazeList.

The design philosophy of GazeList is to provide a fast and seamless experience. The app should stay out of the user's way as much as possible and display only relevant information and actions at any given time.
